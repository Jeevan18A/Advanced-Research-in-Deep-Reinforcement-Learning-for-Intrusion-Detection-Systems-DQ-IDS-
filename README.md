# Deep RL for Intrusion Detection Systems (DQ-IDS)
- Integrated cutting-edge deep RL techniques (Double DQN, Dueling DQN, Transformer-based models) to enhance detection accuracy and model stability in adaptive intrusion detection systems.
- Proposed scalable frameworks using graph-based intrusion detection and federated learning for real-time, low-latency cybersecurity monitoring across distributed networks, including zero-day threat detection.
